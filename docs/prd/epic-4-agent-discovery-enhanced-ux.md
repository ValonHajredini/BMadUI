# Epic 4: Agent Discovery & Enhanced UX

**Epic Goal:** Complete the full BMad GUI vision by implementing comprehensive agent discovery, polishing the three-panel interface to production quality, and delivering the enhanced user experience that makes BMad accessible to both power users and BMad-curious developers. This epic transforms the functional application into a polished product ready for widespread adoption and competitive market positioning.

## Story 4.1: Comprehensive Agent Discovery & Navigation

As a BMad user,
I want to discover and navigate between available agents in my project,
so that I can explore BMad's full capabilities and switch between different AI assistance modes efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Right panel displays a comprehensive list of available agents discovered from `agents/`, `tasks/`, and `workflow/` directories
2. Agent list shows agent names, descriptions, and usage hints when available from agent metadata
3. Agent categories (tasks, workflows, specialized agents) are visually organized for easy navigation
4. Clicking an agent initializes it within the current conversation with appropriate context and greeting
5. Agent switching preserves conversation history while clearly indicating context changes
6. Recently used agents are highlighted or prioritized for quick access during active development
7. Agent search and filtering capabilities help users find specific agents quickly in large projects
8. Agent discovery provides significantly more comprehensive coverage than basic agent invocation from Epic 2

## Story 4.2: Advanced Command Features

As a BMad user,
I want advanced command execution capabilities like queuing, cancellation, and timing,
so that I can manage complex development workflows efficiently.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Command execution can be cancelled by user if process runs longer than expected
2. Multiple commands can be queued and executed sequentially without interface blocking
3. Execution time tracking displays for performance awareness and debugging
4. Command queue management allows reordering and removal of pending commands
5. Background command execution continues while user performs other interface actions
6. Advanced command features integrate seamlessly with basic execution from Epic 2
7. Command execution prioritization allows urgent commands to jump the queue

## Story 4.3: Context Panel & Command Reference

As a BMad user,
I want contextual information and command references readily available,
so that I can work efficiently without memorizing commands or switching to external documentation.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Right panel provides collapsible sections for project context, active agent information, and command references
2. Command reference displays relevant commands for the currently active agent with syntax examples
3. Project context shows current working directory, git status, and other relevant project metadata
4. Panel content updates dynamically based on conversation state and active agent
5. Quick action buttons for common operations (git status, project info, help) are easily accessible
6. Panel width is adjustable and remembers user preferences across sessions
7. Keyboard shortcuts enable rapid panel toggling and navigation without mouse interaction

## Story 4.4: User Experience Polish & Accessibility

As a BMad user,
I want a polished, responsive interface that works consistently across platforms,
so that the application feels professional and reliable for daily development use.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Interface animations and transitions are smooth and purposeful without feeling sluggish
2. Loading states and progress indicators provide clear feedback during longer operations
3. Keyboard accessibility supports full navigation and operation without mouse dependency
4. Application window state (size, position, panel widths) persists across sessions appropriately
5. Error messages and notifications are non-intrusive but clearly visible and actionable
6. Interface adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and resolutions while maintaining usability
7. Color scheme and typography choices optimize for extended development sessions and various lighting conditions

## Story 4.5: Settings & Preferences Management

As a BMad user,
I want to customize application behavior and preferences,
so that the tool adapts to my specific workflow needs and development environment.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Settings interface allows configuration of retention policies, display preferences, and behavior options
2. Theme selection supports light, dark, and system-based automatic theme switching
3. Notification preferences control alerts for command completion, errors, and system events
4. Keyboard shortcut customization enables workflow optimization for individual user preferences
5. Project-specific settings override global preferences when appropriate
6. Settings export/import enables configuration sharing and backup for consistency across installations
7. Settings validation prevents invalid configurations that could break application functionality
