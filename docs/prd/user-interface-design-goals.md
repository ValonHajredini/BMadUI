# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a familiar, low-friction conversational development environment that eliminates the cognitive load of context switching. The interface should feel immediately intuitive to developers already familiar with Slack or similar chat applications, while seamlessly integrating powerful CLI functionality through natural conversation patterns. The design prioritizes developer productivity by reducing interface management overhead and preserving mental energy for creative work.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational-first interaction:** All BMad agent communication flows through natural chat interface rather than command memorization
- **Context-aware navigation:** Left sidebar provides project and agent discovery without disrupting conversation flow
- **Progressive disclosure:** Right panel offers command reference and project context on-demand without cluttering main workspace
- **Persistent conversation threading:** Each project maintains isolated conversation history enabling seamless context continuation across sessions

## Core Screens and Views
- **Project Discovery Screen:** Initial landing showing detected BMad projects with quick access patterns
- **Main Chat Interface:** Primary workspace with three-panel layout (navigation, conversation, context)
- **Agent Selection View:** Interface for discovering and switching between available BMad agents
- **Conversation History Browser:** Search and filter interface for accessing past project conversations
- **Settings and Preferences:** Configuration for retention policies, display preferences, and privacy controls

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The application shall meet WCAG AA standards to ensure accessibility for developers with various needs, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and appropriate color contrast ratios for extended development sessions.

## Branding
Clean, developer-focused aesthetic emphasizing clarity and reduced visual noise. Interface should feel professional yet approachable, avoiding both clinical sterility and excessive visual flourish. Typography and spacing optimized for extended reading during long development sessions, with subtle visual cues that reinforce the local-first privacy positioning.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform Desktop
Native desktop application for Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+) using Electron framework. Interface designed for desktop interaction patterns with mouse and keyboard, optimized for multiple monitor setups common in developer environments.
