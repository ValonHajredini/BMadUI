# Epic 2: Conversational Interface & Command Execution

**Epic Goal:** Transform the CLI experience into a natural conversational interface by implementing the core chat-style interaction pattern with message bubbles and real-time BMad command execution. This epic delivers the primary value proposition that differentiates BMad GUI from existing tools - seamless conversation-driven development workflows that eliminate context switching between CLI and web-based AI chats.

## Story 2.1: Chat Interface Message Display

As a BMad user,
I want to interact through a chat-style interface with message bubbles,
so that BMad agent communication feels natural and conversational rather than command-driven.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Center panel displays a scrollable chat conversation area with distinct message bubble styling
2. User messages appear as right-aligned bubbles with appropriate visual styling and spacing
3. AI/system responses appear as left-aligned bubbles with different visual treatment than user messages
4. Message timestamps are displayed and formatted appropriately for development workflow context
5. Long messages wrap correctly within bubbles without breaking the conversation flow
6. Conversation area auto-scrolls to newest messages while preserving manual scroll position when reviewing history
7. Message input field is prominently positioned at bottom with send button and Enter key support

## Story 2.2: Message Formatting & Display

As a BMad user,
I want rich message formatting that properly displays code, markdown, and structured content,
so that agent responses and command outputs are readable and actionable within the conversation interface.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Markdown rendering displays code blocks, headers, lists, and emphasis correctly within message bubbles
2. Syntax highlighting for code blocks supports major programming languages relevant to development workflows
3. Command output preserves formatting, color coding, and indentation for readability
4. Large code blocks or outputs are displayed in expandable/collapsible sections to manage screen space
5. Copy-to-clipboard functionality works for code blocks, commands, and individual messages
6. Link detection and click handling works for URLs, file paths, and documentation references
7. Message actions (copy, edit, delete, bookmark) are accessible through contextual menus or buttons

## Story 2.3: BMad Command Input Processing

As a BMad user,
I want to type natural language or BMad commands in the chat interface,
so that I can execute BMad agents without switching to terminal.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Message input accepts both natural language and direct BMad command syntax
2. Input validation provides immediate feedback for malformed commands or syntax errors
3. Command history navigation (up/down arrows) works within the input field for efficiency
4. Input field supports multi-line input for complex commands or natural language descriptions
5. Auto-complete suggestions appear for common BMad commands and agent names when typing
6. Input field maintains focus after sending messages to enable rapid conversation flow
7. Special character handling (quotes, backslashes, etc.) works correctly for complex BMad commands

## Story 2.4: Basic Command Execution

As a BMad user,
I want BMad commands to execute with clear feedback,
so that I can see command results within the conversation flow.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Commands execute in the correct project working directory context automatically
2. Execution status indicators (loading, processing, completed) display clearly in the conversation
3. Command output (stdout) appears in the conversation when execution completes
4. Command exit codes and completion status are clearly communicated to user
5. Basic command execution works reliably for single commands
6. Execution context is maintained between consecutive commands
7. Command execution errors are captured and displayed clearly

## Story 2.5: Real-time Output & Progress Feedback

As a BMad user,
I want real-time output streaming and progress indicators during command execution,
so that I can monitor long-running commands without uncertainty.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time output streams (stdout) appear progressively in the conversation as commands execute
2. Progress indicators show active execution state during command processing
3. Output streaming maintains proper formatting and readability
4. Streaming output auto-scrolls conversation to show latest content
5. Output streaming handles large volumes of text without performance degradation
6. Streaming can be paused/resumed if user needs to review previous content
7. Real-time output display integrates seamlessly with message formatting system

## Story 2.6: Error Handling & Recovery

As a BMad user,
I want clear error messages and recovery options when commands fail,
so that I can troubleshoot and continue working efficiently without frustration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Error messages display in distinctive styling within the conversation flow
2. stderr output is captured and displayed separately from stdout with clear visual distinction
3. Common error scenarios (command not found, permission denied, invalid syntax) provide specific helpful guidance
4. Error recovery suggestions are offered contextually based on the type of failure
5. Failed commands can be easily edited and re-executed without retyping entire input
6. BMad installation or configuration issues are detected and reported with actionable resolution steps
7. Network or file system permission errors provide clear explanation and potential solutions

## Story 2.7: Basic Agent Invocation

As a BMad user,
I want to invoke available BMad agents through simple commands,
so that I can begin using AI-assisted development workflows within the GUI.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Basic agent detection from current project allows simple agent invocation
2. Agent responses are captured and displayed appropriately within the conversation flow
3. Agent state and context are maintained throughout the conversation session
4. Simple agent commands work consistently within the chat interface
5. Agent completion signals are detected and communicated clearly to user
6. Basic agent output is formatted using the message formatting system from Story 2.2
7. Simple agent switching commands work for workflow flexibility
