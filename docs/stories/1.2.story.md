# Story 1.2: File System Project Scanner

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** BMad user,
**I want** the application to automatically discover my BMad projects by scanning for `.bmad-core/` directories,
**so that** I can quickly access my projects without manual configuration.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application scans common development directories (~/Projects, ~/Code, ~/Development) for `.bmad-core/` folders
2. Detected projects display project name derived from parent directory name
3. Scanning completes within 5 seconds for typical development directory structures
4. Application handles permission errors gracefully when accessing restricted directories
5. Scan results update when new projects are created or existing projects are moved
6. Empty scan results display helpful messaging suggesting project creation or manual path addition

### Data Models and Interfaces
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface BMadProject {
  id: string;                     // Unique identifier from project path
  name: string;                   // Project name from directory name
  path: string;                   // Absolute path to project directory
  lastAccessed: Date;             // When project was last opened
  agents: BMadAgent[];            // Available agents (empty for this story)
  isActive: boolean;              // Selection state
}
```

### IPC Channel Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specification.md]
```typescript
'project:scan': {
  request: { paths?: string[] };   // Optional custom scan paths
  response: BMadProject[];         // Array of discovered projects
};
```

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
- **ProjectScanner**: Responsibility for automatic .bmad-core/ directory discovery
- **File System API**: Native access for project detection and logs
- **Dependencies**: File System API, BMadAgentDiscovery (future)
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js file system APIs with recursive scanning and file watching

### File Locations and Project Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Project scanner service: `src/main/services/project-scanner.ts`
- IPC handlers: `src/main/handlers/project-handlers.ts`
- Frontend service: `src/renderer/app/core/services/project.service.ts`
- Shared types: `libs/shared/src/interfaces/project.interface.ts` (if using monorepo structure)

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **File Path Validation**: Always validate file paths through SecurityService to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of restricted directory access
- **Path Normalization**: Use path.normalize() to prevent traversal attempts
- **Error Containment**: Never expose full system paths in error messages to frontend

### Performance Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 AC#3]
- **Scan Time Limit**: Must complete within 5 seconds for typical development directories
- **Optimization Strategy**: Implement early termination for deep directory structures
- **Caching**: Use in-memory caching for discovered projects to avoid repeated scans
- **File Watching**: Efficient file system watching to detect new/moved projects

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **File Names**: kebab-case (project-scanner.ts, project.service.ts)
- **Services**: PascalCase + Service (ProjectService)
- **IPC Channels**: namespace:action format (project:scan)
- **Type Sharing**: Define types in shared interfaces, never duplicate across processes
- **Error Handling**: All IPC handlers must use standard error handler patterns

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: Located in `src/renderer/app/core/services/project.service.spec.ts`
- **Backend Tests**: Located in `src/main/services/project-scanner.spec.ts`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Angular Testing utilities for frontend, Jest for backend
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock file system operations for isolated unit testing
- **IPC Testing**: Mock IPC communication with type-safe test utilities

### Project Structure Notes
Current project has foundational Electron + Angular structure established in Story 1.1. This story will add the first business logic services for project discovery, building on the existing IPC infrastructure.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-15

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Rating: EXCELLENT** - This implementation demonstrates high-quality architecture with comprehensive security considerations, proper Angular patterns, and thorough test coverage. The implementation fully meets all acceptance criteria with security enhancements beyond requirements.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Security-First Design**: Enhanced path validation with null-byte injection protection, crypto-based ID generation, and bounded path validation
- **Modern Angular Patterns**: Excellent use of Angular 20+ signals for reactive state management
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript implementation with shared interface definitions
- **Test Quality**: Comprehensive test suite with 28 passing tests covering all edge cases
- **IPC Architecture**: Clean separation between main/renderer processes with type-safe communication

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src/renderer/src/app/core/services/project.service.spec.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed Jest/Jasmine compatibility issues by converting all Jest syntax to proper Jasmine syntax
  - **Why**: Angular uses Jasmine testing framework, but tests were written with Jest patterns causing compilation failures
  - **How**: Replaced `jest.fn()` with `jasmine.createSpy()`, removed `jest.clearAllMocks()`, fixed `expect.any()` calls, and added proper type casting for spies

- **File**: `src/main/services/project-scanner.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced security validation in `createProjectFromPath()` method
  - **Why**: Original implementation had basic path validation but lacked protection against advanced attack vectors
  - **How**: Added null-byte injection protection, path length limits, boundary validation, crypto-based ID generation, and sanitized error messages

- **File**: `src/main/services/project-scanner.ts` & `src/main/handlers/project-handlers.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed import paths for shared interfaces
  - **Why**: Import paths were incorrectly pointing to `../shared/` instead of `../../shared/`
