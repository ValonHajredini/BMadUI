# Story 1.3: Project List Interface

## Status
Review

## Story
**As a** BMad user,
**I want** to see my discovered projects in a clean, navigable list,
**so that** I can select and work with specific BMad projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Left sidebar displays discovered projects in a scrollable list with clear project names
2. Project list shows basic metadata (path, last accessed) when available
3. Interface handles both single and multiple project scenarios gracefully
4. Project list refreshes automatically when file system changes are detected
5. Basic project selection highlighting works without navigation behavior
6. Project list component is self-contained and ready for navigation integration

### Data Models and Interfaces
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
interface BMadProject {
  id: string;                     // Unique identifier from project path
  name: string;                   // Project name from directory name
  path: string;                   // Absolute path to project directory
  lastAccessed: Date;             // When project was last opened
  agents: BMadAgent[];            // Available agents (empty for this story)
  isActive: boolean;              // Selection state
}
```

### Component Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/components.md]
- **ProjectNavigation**: Left sidebar component for project selection, agent discovery, and navigation state management
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `loadProjects(): void` - Load and display discovered projects
  - `selectProject(projectId: string): void` - Handle project selection
  - `displayAgents(agents: BMadAgent[]): void` - Future agent display capability
- **Dependencies**: ProjectService, Router (future), Angular Material
- **Technology Stack**: Angular standalone component with Angular Material navigation components and reactive signals

### File Locations and Project Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Main component: `src/renderer/src/app/features/projects/components/project-list/project-list.component.ts`
- Component styles: `src/renderer/src/app/features/projects/components/project-list/project-list.component.scss`
- Unit tests: `src/renderer/src/app/features/projects/components/project-list/project-list.component.spec.ts`
- Existing service integration: `src/renderer/src/app/core/services/project.service.ts`
- Shared interfaces: `src/shared/interfaces/project.interface.ts`

### State Management Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Signal-based reactivity**: Use Angular signals for fine-grained reactivity
- **Service-based state**: Centralized state management through ProjectService
- **Computed signals**: Derived state using computed() for optimal performance
- **Effect-based side effects**: Use effect() for handling state change reactions

### User Interface Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 AC#1, #2]
- **Left Sidebar Placement**: Component must be positioned in left sidebar area
- **Scrollable List**: Handle multiple projects with proper scrolling behavior
- **Clear Project Names**: Display project names prominently with readable typography
- **Basic Metadata Display**: Show path and last accessed date when available
- **Visual Selection**: Clear highlighting for selected projects without navigation

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Component Names**: PascalCase (ProjectListComponent)
- **File Names**: kebab-case (project-list.component.ts)
- **Signal Names**: camelCase (selectedProject, projectList)
- **State Updates**: Never mutate signals directly - use service methods
- **Type Sharing**: Import BMadProject from shared interfaces

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: `src/renderer/src/app/features/projects/components/project-list/project-list.component.spec.ts`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest + Angular Testing utilities
- **Component Testing**: Angular TestBed for component setup and testing
- **Service Mocking**: Mock ProjectService with proper signal behavior
- **Signal Testing**: Test signal updates and computed signal reactions
- **UI Testing**: Test component rendering, selection behavior, and user interactions

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, Epic AC#6]
- **Self-contained Design**: Component must not trigger navigation behavior
- **Ready for Integration**: Prepare for future navigation integration without breaking changes
- **Angular Material**: Use Material UI components for consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Handle different window sizes gracefully
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering for large project lists

### Project Structure Notes
Component will be created within the established Angular features structure. ProjectService from Story 1.2 provides the data layer, and this component will focus purely on presentation and user interaction without navigation concerns.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality with modern Angular patterns. The ProjectListComponent demonstrates outstanding architecture with proper signal-based reactivity, comprehensive error handling, and accessibility features. The code follows Material Design principles and implements responsive design patterns effectively.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: project-list.component.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed date calculation logic in `formatLastAccessed()` method
  - **Why**: Previous logic had off-by-one errors causing incorrect "Today/Yesterday" labels
  - **How**: Changed to use `Math.floor()` instead of `Math.ceil()` and adjusted day difference calculations

- **File**: project-list.component.ts
  - **Change**: Improved type declarations for public signals
  - **Why**: Removed non-null assertion operators for cleaner code
  - **How**: Declared proper types in constructor initialization

- **File**: project-list.component.ts
  - **Change**: Extracted index validation logic to private method
  - **Why**: Improves code readability and reusability
  - **How**: Added `isValidProjectIndex()` helper method

- **File**: project-list.component.spec.ts
  - **Change**: Fixed test expectation for date formatting
  - **Why**: Test was expecting incorrect value for 3-day difference
  - **How**: Updated expectation to match correct implementation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with naming conventions, type sharing, and architectural patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect adherence to documented frontend architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with 41 passing tests and full coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ Complete implementation of all 6 acceptance criteria with full traceability

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed date calculation logic in formatLastAccessed method (project-list.component.ts)
- [x] Improved type safety by removing non-null assertions (project-list.component.ts)
- [x] Added helper method for index validation (project-list.component.ts)
- [x] Corrected test expectations for date formatting (project-list.component.spec.ts)
- [x] Verified all 41 tests pass with comprehensive coverage
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests with actual ProjectService
- [ ] Consider adding visual regression tests for responsive design
- [ ] Consider performance testing with large project lists (1000+ projects)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Component properly validates all inputs, handles errors gracefully, and follows secure coding practices. All IPC communication goes through the service layer as required by coding standards.

### Performance Considerations

Excellent performance characteristics implemented:
- trackBy function for efficient list rendering
- Signal-based reactivity for minimal re-renders
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first approach
- Proper memory cleanup in component destruction
