# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
- XSS Prevention: Angular's built-in sanitization + input validation
- Secure Storage: Electron's safeStorage API for sensitive data

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Strict command validation and path sanitization
- Rate Limiting: Per-process execution limits to prevent resource abuse
- CORS Policy: Not applicable (local IPC communication)

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: Not applicable (local-only application)
- Session Management: Local state management only
- Password Policy: Not applicable (no user accounts)

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <5MB total application bundle
- Loading Strategy: Lazy loading with @defer blocks for non-critical UI
- Caching Strategy: In-memory component state + browser caching for assets

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <100ms for IPC communication, <500ms for command initiation
- Database Optimization: SQLite indexing + prepared statements + connection pooling
- Caching Strategy: In-memory caching for frequently accessed project/agent metadata
