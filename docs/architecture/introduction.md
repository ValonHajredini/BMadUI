# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **BMad GUI**, including the Electron main process backend, Angular 20 frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for this modern desktop application where these concerns are increasingly intertwined through Electron's architecture.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

The BMad GUI is being built from scratch as a greenfield desktop application. However, I recommend considering modern Electron + Angular starters to accelerate development:

- **Electron + Angular Template**: Consider using `electron-builder` with Angular CLI for streamlined setup
- **Cross-Platform Desktop Starters**: Templates like `electron-forge` with Angular integration
- **TypeScript Desktop Templates**: Pre-configured setups with Angular signals and standalone components

Given your aggressive 2-4 week timeline, using a proven Electron + Angular starter template could save significant setup time while ensuring best practices are followed from the start.
